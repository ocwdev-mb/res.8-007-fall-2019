The first stars forged metals heavier than hydrogen and helium in their cores to produce energy to shine. These heavier elements were then expelled into space once the stars exploded as the first massive supernovae. Since then, massive exploding stars have contributed elements to the universe thus setting in motion the cosmic chemical evolution. Consequently, old stars formed from gas enriched by only one or few supernovae and younger stars like the sun formed from gas enriched by perhaps a thousand events.
